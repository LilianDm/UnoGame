# UnusGame
A group project about a game similar to Uno, with images, cards, and competition. In this game, we will have specialized cards to play against an AI, a start screen, and an end screen. We plan to have a smooth way to play and place down cards, interesting cards, and a deck that randomly gives cards to the player and the AI.
