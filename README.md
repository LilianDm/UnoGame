# UnusGame👺🚀⬇️
A group project about a game similar to Uno, with images, cards, and competition. In this game, we will have specialized cards to play against an AI.. We plan to have a smooth way to play and place down interesting cards, and a deck that randomly gives cards to the player and the AI.

## Project Objectives🤌⬇️

* A user vs. AI simulation (similar to UNO)
* We can see the hand through the console



## User-Interface and Logic Planning🤖⬇️
### Define the card class:
* Create a list of cards with colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow) and values (0 to 9, Skip, Wild, Plus2, Plus4).
### Define the players🧏🏽⬇️
* Create a Player class with a hand attribute to store the player's cards.
* Initialize the user and AI players with empty hands.
* Deal 7 cards to each player from the deck.
* Uses buttons as slots that can be used to play the cards for both the player and the ai.
### Game loop💡⬇️
* While neither player has empty hands:
* User's turn:  
  * Ask the user to choose a card to play.
  * Check if the chosen card is a valid move.
  * If valid, play the card and update the pile.
* AI's turn:🤖
 * AI plays a random valid card from its hand.
 * The deck and pile are then updated.
* Check for Uno and Win conditions.
